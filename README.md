# project overview
### This is a website dedicated to show family and friends where I go hiking, camping, and backpacking when I go to the Red River Gorge. Once you sign up, you can go to the map and explore the icons and trail list. If you click on the icon you can follow a link to the website/app ALLTrails and eplore the same trail in a much more robust way. 

#### How to start. Go to the RRG files to open the landing page where you can sign up and go to the map. You can access the map by also using the rrgmap files. Once the map is pulled up, enjoy ecploring the list of trails and the icons located at geographical points of interest. You can follow the icon links to the website ALlTrails. 

#### Project requirements. 
##### You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience The two media queries must be designed with “mobile first” principles in mind
 ##### This means mobile phones should be the base for the css. 
##### Then use a tablet media query to make changes for that experience. 
##### And Then a Desktop media query to make changes for the desktop experience. 
##### We should be able to see your site change layout as we make your site larger or smaller.

##### Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
##### Project includes a README file that explains the following:
##### Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
##### Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.

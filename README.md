# project overview
### This is a website dedicated to show family and friends where I go hiking, camping, and backpacking when I go to the Red River Gorge. Once you sign up, you can go to the map and explore the icons and trail list. If you click on the icon you can follow a link to the website/app ALLTrails and eplore the same trail in a much more robust way. 

#### How to start. Go to the RRG files to open the landing page where you can sign up and go to the map. You can access the map by also using the rrgmap files. Once the map is pulled up, enjoy ecploring the list of trails and the icons located at geographical points of interest. You can follow the icon links to the website ALlTrails. 

#### Project requirements. 
##### Visually Appealing. 
##### Media queries on both the landing page and map. 
##### landing page - 1. the logo, sign up menu, and go to map button will start with a mobile first design and change size and position when expanded. The Flexbox and gride requirements were met. There has been 5+ git commits. The javascript requirements are the sign up menue movement, and Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
###### The map. The map trail list will change position when expanded. The logo will change size, and every other circle in the trail list is a different color.

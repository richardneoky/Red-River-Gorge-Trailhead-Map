# project overview
### This is a website dedicated to show family and friends where I go hiking, camping, and backpacking when I go to the Red River Gorge. Once you sign up, you can go to the map and explore the icons and trail list. If you click on the icon you can follow a link to the website/app ALLTrails and eplore the same trail in a much more robust way. 

#### How to start. Go to the RRG files to open the landing page where you can sign up and go to the map. You can access the map by also using the rrgmap files. Once the map is pulled up, enjoy ecploring the list of trails and the icons located at geographical points of interest. You can follow the icon links to the website ALlTrails. 

#### Project requirements. 
### CSS and JS functions that I implemented 

### Sign up/Landing page
##### On the sign up landing page, I used media queries to start with a mobile first design. 

##### I used flex to move the “go to map” button from vertical alignment with the logo, to horizontal alignment with the logo once the page is expanded. 

##### I used Javascript to create a back and forth motion on the sign in panel. I also used javascript to prompt messages to the user for email confirmation, and a password length alert. 

### Map Page

##### On this page, there are several icons indicating the location of trails I like to frequent at the Red River Gorge. If you click on the tent icon, a pop up window will appear with the name of the trail and a link to that trail on the website “ALlTrails”.

##### This was also made with a mobile first design with media queries. At the bottom of the page there is a trail list. When you put the mouse over the list, it will go up the page, and you can highlight and see what trails the icons represent. I used nth-child to make every other green circle in the list the color red. 

##### When the page is expanded the trail list moves to the far top right of the map, and the logo also gets progressively larger to fit the new screen size.
